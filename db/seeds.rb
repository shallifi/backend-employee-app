# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)


# Agency.create!([{
#     name: "Safe Children Coalition, Inc"

# {
#     name: "Lutheran Services of Florida"

# {
#     name: "The Florida Center for Early Childhood"

#     name: "Covenant Kids Manor of Florida"
